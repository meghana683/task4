# Logistic Regression - Binary Classification

## ðŸŽ¯ Objective
To build a binary classification model using Logistic Regression that predicts whether a tumor is malignant or benign using the Breast Cancer Wisconsin Dataset.

---

## ðŸ“Š Dataset

- **Name**: Breast Cancer Wisconsin (Diagnostic)
- **Source**: Scikit-learn built-in datasets
- **Features**: 30 numeric measurements
- **Target**:
  - `0` - Malignant
  - `1` - Benign

---

## ðŸ§° Tools Used

- Python 3.x
- Pandas
- Scikit-learn
- Matplotlib
- Seaborn

---

## ðŸ”„ Workflow

1. Load dataset using `load_breast_cancer()`
2. Split into training and testing data
3. Train Logistic Regression model
4. Predict on test data
5. Evaluate using accuracy and confusion matrix

---

## ðŸ“ˆ Results

- Model achieved around 95â€“97% accuracy
- Confusion matrix shows strong performance in both classes

---

## ðŸš€ Future Improvements

- Apply feature scaling (e.g., StandardScaler)
- Try other models like SVM, Random Forest
- Perform k-fold cross-validation
